-- ============================================================================
-- KOI — The ingredient knowledge base
--
-- `ingredients_master` has existed since migration 00003 and has held zero rows
-- ever since. That emptiness is the reason KOI cannot yet answer the questions
-- a diet copilot is actually asked. Nutrition numbers tell you a product has
-- 4.2 g of sugar; they cannot tell you the sugar is invert syrup, that "milk
-- solids" means a dairy allergen, that INS 621 is MSG, or that the fat is palm.
-- Those are ingredient questions, and until this table is populated nothing in
-- the system can reason about them.
--
-- WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT:
-- This is the RULES library — the canonical names, the aliases a label might
-- use, and KOI's position on each. It is not per-product data. `sku_ingredients`
-- (also empty) is where a given SKU's declared ingredient list belongs, and
-- filling that needs real label text, which is a separate job. Seeding this
-- table changes no UI today. It is groundwork, deliberately.
--
-- HOW risk_level SHOULD BE READ — please read this before relying on it:
-- `risk_level` is an EDITORIAL POSITION, not a fact, and it is the one column
-- here a reasonable expert could disagree with. Each row's `notes` states the
-- basis for its level so a reviewer can check the reasoning rather than the
-- conclusion. The levels mean:
--
--   safe     — permitted, well characterised, no substantive live controversy
--   caution  — permitted, but there is a reason a health-first brand would
--              rather flag it: a declarable allergen, a refined ingredient, an
--              additive with a real and ongoing safety debate
--   risky    — permitted in India but carrying a specific documented concern
--              serious enough that another major regulator restricts or warns
--   blocked  — not permitted in India, or effectively ended by an FSSAI limit
--
-- SOMEONE QUALIFIED SHOULD REVIEW THESE BEFORE THEY DRIVE CUSTOMER-FACING
-- CLAIMS OR BLOCK A PRODUCT. A wrong 'risky' is a public accusation about a
-- brand; a wrong 'safe' is the failure this table exists to prevent. Regulatory
-- positions also move — the trans fat limit and the potassium bromate delisting
-- below are both recent — so treat this as a snapshot needing maintenance, not
-- a settled reference.
--
-- `aliases` carries what a LABEL actually prints, which is the whole point:
-- matching only on canonical names would miss "E621", "ajinomoto" and
-- "flavour enhancer (621)", all of which are the same substance.
--
-- Idempotent: re-running updates in place and never duplicates.
--
-- The table lives in the `food` schema since migration 00019, not `public`.
