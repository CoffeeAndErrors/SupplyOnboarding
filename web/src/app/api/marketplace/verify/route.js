// There is no lookup-by-id at the provider, so verifying one product costs a
// search. That is the entire reason this route is bounded, cached and
// coalesced rather than called freely.

// provider's opaque id cross this boundary. Names, brands and pack sizes stay
// server-side as matching input.
