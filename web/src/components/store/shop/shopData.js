// ============================================================================
// KOI SHOP - Data & facets for the editorial discovery experience.
//
// The real catalogue flows through fetchAllProducts(). Everything below the
// facets is DEVELOPMENT FIXTURE DATA so the UI is buildable before a supply
// source exists.
//
// THE BRANDS BELOW ARE INVENTED. That is deliberate and load-bearing.
//
// These fixtures used to name real third-party companies - Troovy, Open
// Secret, KisaanSay, Sweet Karam Coffee - and attach hand-written scores and
// claims to them. The Troovy butter cookies carried a 92 and "0 g sugar" where
// KOI's own label reading (scripts/seedTroovy.js) records a 78 and 20.9 g of
// added sugar. Publishing that asserts a verification verdict KOI never issued,
// about someone else's product.
//
// getSeedCatalogue() gates them out of production, which stops them RENDERING.
// It does not stop them SHIPPING: the bundler keeps the array in the client
// chunk as dead code, so the false claim was still downloadable by anyone who
// opened the JS. Fictional brands close that gap for good - there is now no
// arrangement of bundler behaviour, import order or future refactor that can
// cause KOI to publish a claim about a real company from this file.
//
// Product images still point at the real photography so layout, aspect ratios
// and colour all get exercised. A real pack shot under an invented brand name
// is unmistakably a fixture, which is the point.
