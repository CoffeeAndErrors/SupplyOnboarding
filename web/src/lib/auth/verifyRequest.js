// ============================================================================
// KOI — Who is calling this route?
//
// SERVER ONLY. Resolves the signed-in shopper from the request's Supabase
// session cookies, or null.
//
// This exists because proxy.js is a REDIRECT HINT, not a boundary: it decides
// where to send a browser, it runs only on the three /store paths it matches,
// and it does not run for API routes at all. Any route that acts on a specific
// shopper — spending their provider quota, replacing their cart — has to
// establish who they are for itself.
//
// WHAT CHANGED WITH THE MOVE OFF FIREBASE:
// This used to verify a Firebase ID token against Google's published JWKS by
// hand, checking signature, issuer, audience and expiry. supabase.auth.getUser()
// does the equivalent and more: it does not trust the cookie's contents at all,
// it asks the Auth server whether this token is currently valid. That closes a
// gap the old code could not — a token revoked mid-life still passed a local
// signature check until it expired.
//
// It costs a network round trip per call. That is the right trade for the two
// routes using it, which already make provider calls; do not reach for it in a
// hot read path. getSession() is the cheap alternative and is NOT a substitute:
// it decodes the cookie without validating it, so it answers "what does this
// cookie claim" rather than "who is this".
//
// Two independent checks guard shopper data, and neither trusts the other:
// this one (KOI's own routes) and public.koi_uid() inside Postgres (RLS).
// ============================================================================

 * The verified shopper behind a request, or null.

 *
 * `uid` is the Supabase Auth user id and is what every customer-tier table
 * keys on (see migration 00013). The field keeps its name because it is KOI's
 * customer key, not because it is still a Firebase UID.
 *
 * @param {import('next/server').NextRequest} request
 * @returns {Promise<{ uid: string, email: string|null, role: string|null }|null>}
