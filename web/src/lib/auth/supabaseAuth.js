// KOI — Email and password, for the supplier dashboard
//
// This is the supplier-side sign-in behind /login. Shoppers do not use it:
// the storefront signs in with phone and OTP (lib/auth/phoneAuth.js), browsing
// signed out until checkout.
//
// It replaces lib/firebase/auth.js one call at a time — same function names,
// same thrown-error contract — so LoginForm changes its import and little else.
//
// WHY EMAIL/PASSWORD SURVIVED THE MOVE OFF FIREBASE:
// Suppliers already have accounts with passwords and no reason to own a Google
// account; removing it would have locked them out to serve a shopper-side
// decision. Supabase has email/password enabled on this project, so keeping it
// costs nothing.
