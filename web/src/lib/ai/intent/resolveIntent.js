// ============================================================================
// KOI — Query Intent · Resolver
// Turns an intent into the set of product ids that satisfy it, by running the
// shopper's merged profile through the KRE's own eligibility stage and then
// applying the limits they asked for.
//
// This is the only module that sees both an intent and the catalogue, which is
// why the integrity checks live here rather than in the interpreter:
//
//   1. Undeclared beats plausible. A limit on a macro ("under 200 calories")
//      excludes a product whose figure KOI has never been told. `null <= 200`
//      is true, and letting that through would publish a calorie claim derived
//      from missing data — the fault shelves.js documents for shelf membership.
//      Same rule, same reason, one guard: `isNum` from the KRE.
//
//   2. A figure is only comparable within one measurement basis, so every
//      figure is converted to one before it is compared. `sku_nutrition` holds
//      `per_100g` for most rows and `per_serving` for a few; comparing the two
//      silently is how "under 200 calories" would treat a 200-per-serving
//      product and a 200-per-100g one as the same food. This used to exclude
//      any row not declared `per_100g`, because the normalized columns were all
//      NULL and a serving could not be converted. `lib/nutrition/basis.js` now
//      does that conversion, so a per-serving row is converted rather than
//      dropped — and one whose serving size KOI cannot read still fails, since
//      an unconvertible figure is no better than a missing one.
//      A product with NO stated basis is compared as-is and counted in
//      diagnostics: live rows all declare one, so that case is the dev fixtures,
//      and excluding them would make search look broken in development while
//      changing nothing about production.
//
//   4. A claim KOI publishes must mean the same thing everywhere. "High protein"
//      is KOI's own words, so it carries the same two gates as the storefront
//      badge — dense enough per 100 AND enough in a real serving. Without the
//      second gate, search would return a 5 g spoonful of Golden Milk Mix as a
//      high-protein result while its own product card, having applied that
//      gate, declines to make the claim. "Low sugar" likewise carries the
//      solid/liquid rule from lib/nutrition/claims.js.
//
//   3. A residual word that matches nothing is dropped, not applied. Filler the
//      phrase table did not recognise would otherwise be used as a substring
//      and empty the grid. Only text that actually matches a product survives.
//
// Eligibility itself is NOT reimplemented here. Hard constraints go through
// `filterEligible`, so an allergen is removed by the same code path whether it
// came from a sentence or from the onboarding form.
