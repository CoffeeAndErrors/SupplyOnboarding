// ============================================================================
// KOI — Substitutes
//
// When a product a shopper wants cannot be bought right now, what should KOI
// offer instead?
//
// THE ANSWER IS NEVER A PROVIDER'S SUGGESTION.
//
// The adapter contract can return the provider's own `similarProducts`, and it
// is tempting to surface them: they are guaranteed in stock and they are free.
// But a provider's substitute is a product KOI has NOT screened. Putting one
// in front of a shopper — on a storefront whose entire proposition is that
// someone read the label first — is the storefront vouching for food it knows
// nothing about. That is the same failure as an invented KOI score, arriving
// through a different door, and it would be at its most damaging exactly where
// a shopper is most trusting: at the moment their first choice fell through.
//
// So substitutes come from KOI's OWN catalogue: screened, scored, and ranked
// by the same engine that ranks everything else. The provider is asked only
// one question about them — "can this be bought right now?" — which is the
// only question it is authoritative on.
//
// Cost: candidates are capped, because each one costs a provider search. The
// cap is enforced again at the API boundary (MAX_SKUS).
