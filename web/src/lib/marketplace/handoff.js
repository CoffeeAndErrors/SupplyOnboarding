// ============================================================================
// KOI — The hand-off
//
// SERVER ONLY. Two phases, and the split is not ceremony:
//
//   PREPARE  read-only. Asks the provider what it would accept. Repeatable as
//            many times as a shopper reloads the reconciliation screen, costs
//            nothing but quota, and changes nothing anywhere.
//
//   COMMIT   the ONLY destructive call in the entire system. The provider's
//            cart is singular and `update_cart` REPLACES it, so committing
//            twice does not add items twice — it silently discards whatever
//            the first commit put there and rebuilds from a stale plan.
//
// EXACTLY-ONCE IS ENFORCED IN POSTGRES, NOT IN JAVASCRIPT. The plan row's
// `committed_at` is set by a conditional UPDATE that only matches while it is
// still null. Two concurrent commits race in the database and exactly one wins;
// the loser is told the plan is already committed. A JS-side flag would be a
// per-process guess, and there is more than one process.
//
// A plan is short-lived on purpose. Stock and prices move, and a plan is a
// snapshot of a claim about them — past expiry it is re-prepared rather than
// trusted, which is affordable precisely because prepare is read-only.
