/**
 * The request ceiling, and why it is this tight.
 *
 * Logged-out browse runs on ONE house credential, so the provider's per-user
 * limit is the ENTIRE storefront's browse budget — not a per-shopper
 * allowance. The cache is therefore not an optimisation; it is the only reason
 * browse is possible at all.
 *
 * Capacity is: distinct live keys <= requestsPerMinute × (TTL.shelfMs / 60s).
 * At 60 req/min and a 60s shelf TTL that is ~60 distinct (zone, shelf) pairs
 * live at once. Exceeding it must DEGRADE (serve stale, else unknown), never
 * queue — a queue turns a quota problem into a latency problem and still
 * breaches the quota.
 *
 * Swiggy's documented ceilings, per authenticated user PER SERVER
 * (docs/operate/rate-limits.md): 70 requests/min general, 30 requests/min for
 * WRITE tools, with a 2x burst allowance over a 10-second window. 60 leaves
 * headroom for item verification and the hand-off.
 *
 * The write limit is the tighter constraint in practice, because the hand-off
 * spends three of them in a row — update_cart, checkout, confirm_order — and
 * update_cart replaces the whole cart, so a retry is never free.
 *
 * ENFORCEMENT IS CONTRADICTORY IN SWIGGY'S OWN DOCS, unresolved as of
 * 2 September 2026:
 *   · rate-limits.md          429 Too Many Requests, X-RateLimit-* headers,
 *                             Retry-After, "stop retrying immediately"
 *   · ship-to-production.md   "MCP-layer rate limiting is not enforced in
 *                             v1.0 - you will not see 429", shipping in v1.1
 * Design for the stricter reading. Being wrong that way costs a little
 * throughput; being wrong the other way gets a credential revoked.
