// ============================================================================
// KOI — Swiggy Instamart adapter
//
// SERVER ONLY. Implements the Phase 3 contract against Swiggy's 19 Instamart
// MCP tools. Nothing above lib/marketplace/ knows this file exists.
//
// UNVERIFIED AGAINST THE LIVE SERVER — KOI has no credentials. The response
// mapping is pure and tested (./mapping.js); the transport framing is a
// documented guess (./client.js). Treat every method here as correct in shape
// and unconfirmed in fact until one read-only call has been made on staging.
//
// THREE PROVIDER FACTS THIS DESIGN IS BUILT AROUND:
//
// 1. There is no anonymous read. `search_products` requires an `addressId`
//    from `get_addresses`, and addresses belong to an authenticated user. So
//    availability for a signed-out shopper is only possible via a KOI house
//    account — an open question with Swiggy, not a capability KOI has.
//
// 2. There is no lookup by id. Verifying one product costs a search, which is
//    why verification is demand-driven and cached rather than swept.
//
// 3. The cart is destructive and singular. One cart per account per server, and
//    `update_cart` REPLACES it wholesale. That is why the hand-off is two
//    phase: prepare reads and is repeatable, commit writes exactly once.
